## Pedagogical Principles Applied

### 1. Krashen's i+1 (Input Hypothesis)
Each lesson introduces vocabulary that is **slightly beyond** current knowledge while reinforcing what was learned before.

### 2. Comprehensible Input
- Words taught with **context sentences**
- Phonetic guides for difficult sounds
- Cultural tips where relevant

### 3. Thematic Clustering
Related words are taught together (e.g., "café" with "um" and "por favor") so learners can immediately form useful phrases.

### 4. Frequency-Based Priority
High-frequency words are introduced first:
- Top 100 words cover ~50% of everyday speech
- Top 1000 words cover ~80% of everyday speech

### 5. Building Block Approach
Grammar structures introduced in order:
1. **Subject pronouns** (eu, tu, ele/ela) - needed for any verb use
2. **Articles** (o, a, um, uma) - needed for any noun use
3. **Essential verbs** (ser, estar, ter) - most frequent verbs
4. **Basic prepositions** (de, em, para) - needed for location/direction
